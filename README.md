- # Sebastian Aburto  
	- ## About me  
		- I am software developer and lifelong learner.  
		- I love programming and implements software solutions.  
		- I am passionate about software development in terms like practices, process, architecture, social-interactions, etc.  
	- ## Currently learning ... a lot of things :) 
	- ## Skills (using Dreyfus Model)  
		- ## Proficient:  
			- **Object oriented design and programming**:  
				- I had experience on multiples projects using Object oriented languages  
				- I can make decisions according to my experiences and intuition  
				- I can apply patterns and recognize common pitfalls and make the code more maintainable.  
			- **Test driven development**:  
				- I had several years of practicing TDD and I feel productive enough  
				- I can recognize when not using, decide of when use mocks or create more sociable tests  
				- Also applying care about the maintainability of the test as well  
				- I teach it about in coding dojos and in pair programming.  
			- **Software architecture**:  
				- I have been exposed to numerous complex systems and diverse architectures.  
				- I had hands-on experiences with different styles of architectures, giant monolith, SOA, microservices, and event-driven.  
				- I had to modify and improve not scalable applications, choosing different technologies or using various designs to improve them.  
				- Made from scratch high-level system architecture proposals, involving different components, services, teams and organizations.  
				- Made and implemented application level architectures, using ports and adapters style using a core domain design driven by the business uses cases. Make it easy to test different parts in an isolated way. Easy to maintain and change.

	- ## How/Where I like to work?  
		- I like to work in companies that know software development is a part of their core business.

		- Where the psychology safety is taken seriously not only for a slogan  
		- Where the teams are self-managed and the hierarchy is lean and flat as possible  
		- Where the continuous improvement is something encourage  
	- ## Job Programming assessment  
		- These are some programming assessments I made in the past for some companies when I tried to apply. Maybe this will give you a little idea of how I code in a short time with minimal requirements :)
